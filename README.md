# topolm
Code for training and evaluating TDANN language models. See the [TopoLM paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11516).

## directory
* model specification / training code is in `models`
* model evaluation scripts are in `eval`
* fMRI data + analysis scripts are in `fMRI`
* `figures` stores plots generated by eval scripts

## dependencies
you can install all python dependencies with `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`
* torch v2.x (for flash attn + model compilation)
* huggingface datasets (for fineweb / owt), tiktoken (for bpe)
* omegaconf, wandb, tqdm
* matplotlib, seaborn
* esda, libpysal (for moran's I computation)
* pandas, numpy v2.x, scipy

## trained models
you can access the models we trained / analyzed in the paper [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1CM4cElxPoPuIA4eaSwr11959H8IKiVES).
